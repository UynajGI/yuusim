## Introduction
`yuusim` is a powerful and flexible template repository tailored specifically for Python projects. It simplifies the development process by leveraging `uv` for dependency management, which ensures a consistent and reproducible environment across different development and deployment stages.

### Key Features
- **Dependency Management**: With `uv`, `yuusim` provides a straightforward way to manage project dependencies. It locks down specific versions of packages, preventing issues caused by version mismatches and ensuring that your project runs smoothly in any environment.
- **Modular Design**: The project is organized into multiple core modules, each responsible for a distinct set of functions. This modular approach enhances code maintainability, reusability, and readability. You can easily extend or modify individual modules without affecting the entire project.
- **Simulation Framework**: `yuusim` comes with a comprehensive simulation framework that handles the initialization, configuration, execution, and cleanup of simulation projects. It supports parallel execution and performance analysis, allowing you to efficiently run simulations and optimize their performance.
- **Documentation**: The project includes detailed documentation for each module, making it easy for developers to understand and use the codebase. You can find the module documentation [here](modules.md).


## Module Documentation
You can find detailed documentation for each module below:

- [Simulation Module Documentation](simulation/index.md)

- [Input/Output Module Documentation](io/index.md)

- [Utility Module Documentation](utils/index.md)

## Installation

### Getting Started
If you're new to `yuusim`, here's a quick guide to help you get started:

#### Clone the Repository
To get a local copy of the `yuusim` project, you can use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UynajGI/yuusim.git
cd yuusim
```

#### 2. Set Up the Environment

Use `uv` to install the project dependencies:
```bash
uv install
```

#### 3. Run a Simple Simulation

Here's an example of how to run a simple simulation using `yuusim`:
```python
from yuusim.simulation import SimulationEnvironment

def sample_function(params):
    # Replace this with your actual simulation logic
    return params

env = SimulationEnvironment("sample_project")
env.load(sample_function)
results = env.run()
print(results)
```
